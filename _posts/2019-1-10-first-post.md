*Hello*, welcome to my blog.

Here, I plan on sharing updates about my life, posting about projects and technology that excites me, and reviewing some books. I've tried to serialize my life in this format a number of times in the past but I usually lose interest before long. I think generally my problem is that I find it hard to coalesce my thoughts when I'm writing unprompted. In the past, I would begin to write out posts but then go off on so many tangents, ending up with ramblings that I ultimately decide against sharing. This time, though, I'm hoping the fact that I'm paying to host this website will inspire me to actually utilize this space. Also, I recently realized I'm no longer as good a writer as I thought I was so this should also help in that regard.  

The blog (and the site as a whole actually) isn't quite finished yet. There's a bunch of stuff I want to add (mainly a comment system, for when I inevitably become internet famous), so I think I'll be messing with it frequently enough to actually feel compelled to post here.

I guess that's it for now. As mentioned, this whole thing is in development, so I'd appreciate some feedback. Feel free to connect with me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/papakojoampimdarko), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Papakoj), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/papakojo/), or send me an email at [ampimdar@grinnell.edu](mailto:ampimdar@grinnell.edu).
