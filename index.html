    <p id="brief"> a brief introduction: </p>
    <p>I'm a Computer Science major at Grinnell College who is interested in projects aimed at using innovative strategies to combine technology and education. I believe that by improving access to technology in classrooms, we can open up entire worlds to young children, and encourage them to explore exciting new opportunities. When I'm not doing CS things, I enjoy playing football (soccer), watching movies, and debating the merits of various conspiracy theories.</p>
